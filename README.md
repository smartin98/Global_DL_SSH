# Global_DL_SSH
Neural network method for mapping global sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature (SST) observations.

This repo contains python code to fully reproduce our training and inference workflow for global SSH mapping from satellite altimetry and gridded SST observations (ADD PREPRINT LINK).
